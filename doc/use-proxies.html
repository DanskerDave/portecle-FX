    <h1>How to use proxy servers</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
      Portecle may access the network when fetching certificates or
      CRL's, or when <a href="examine-tls.html">examining an SSL/TLS
      connection</a>. If your environment requires using a
      nontransparent proxy server to access these destinations,
      Portecle needs to be configured to use it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Portecle does not implement any proxy support itself, but the
      standard Java proxy mechanisms are available for use with it;
      refer to the
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html">Java
        Networking and Proxies</a> and
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/doc-files/net-properties.html#Proxies">Networking
        Properties</a> documents for details on configuring HTTP,
      HTTPS, SOCKS, and system default proxy details using system
      properties. Add the mentioned properties as arguments to Java
      (not Portecle), i.e. before <code>portecle.jar</code>
      or <code>FPortecle</code>, to the command used to start
      Portecle. For example:
      <kbd>java -Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true -jar portecle.jar</kbd>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the examine SSL/TLS connection functionality does not
      use HTTPS even when checking the connection to an HTTPS
      service. Therefore the HTTPS proxy settings have no effect on
      it, but the SOCKS proxy applies. The SOCKS proxy also applies to
      other network accesses, see the above mentioned documents for
      more details.
