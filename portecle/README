 Portecle README
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Getting up and running with Portecle is quick and easy.  Everything you
need to know is detailed below.  Being written in Java, Portecle will run
on any machine that has a suitable JVM installed.  Note that a prerequisite is
that you must have at least JRE/JDK v 1.4.0 on your machine.  The latest
version of the JRE/JDK is available for free from java.sun.com.  Once
Portecle is installed you will be able to access its online help.

1 Installing
------------

Place the Portecle JAR file (portecle.jar) on your filesystem.  Next get
Bouncy Castle Provider version 1.20 or later (version 1.25b06 or later
recommended) for your JDK (bcprov-jdk*-*.jar).  This is available for free
from www.bouncycastle.org.  Be sure to get the version corresponding to your
JRE (1.4 or 1.5)!  Place it in the *same* directory as portecle.jar, and
rename it to bcprov.jar.  You now have everything you need to run Portecle
from the command line. Included below are example command lines for Windows
and UNIX systems.

The examples assume that the Java bin directory has been added to your path.

1.1 Windows Command Line
------------------------

Assuming you have an appropriate JRE/JDK installed and have placed the
Portecle and BouncyCastle Provider JAR files into a directory c:\portecle you
can run Portecle like so:

  java -jar c:\portecle\portecle.jar

The portecle.jar contains an icon file (portecle.ico) for use with Portecle.

In most setups, if portecle.jar and bcprov.jar were installed as instructed
above, Portecle can also be run by double-clicking portecle.jar in the
Windows Explorer.

1.2 UNIX Command Line
---------------------

Assuming you have an appropriate JRE/JDK installed and have placed the
Portecle and BouncyCastle Provider JAR files into a directory /portecle you
can run Portecle like so:

  java -jar /portecle/portecle.jar

1.3 Experimental Features
-------------------------

Portecle releases may contain experimental features that are not enabled
by default.  These have known limitations or incomplete implementations
that make them unsuitable for production use, but they may be valuable for
early adopters.  To enable these features, use "-Dportecle.experimental=true"
in your Portecle invocation command line.  See the file NEWS for information
about status of current experimental features.
