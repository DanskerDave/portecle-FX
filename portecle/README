Getting up and running with Portecle is quick and easy.  Everything you
need to know is detailed below.  Being written in Java, Portecle will run
on any machine that has a suitable JVM installed.  Note that a prerequisite is
that you must have at least JRE/JDK v 1.4.0 on your machine.  The latest
version of the JRE/JDK is available for free from java.sun.com.  Once
Portecle is installed you will be able to access its online help.

1 Installing
------------

Place the Portecle JAR file (portecle-0.9.jar) on your filesystem.  Next get
Bouncy Castle Provider version 1.20 for JDK 1.4 (bcprov-jdk14-120.jar).  This
is available for free from www.bouncycastle.org.  Note that only version 1.20
will work.  Place it in the *same* directory as portecle.jar.  You now have
everything you need to run Portecle from the command-line. Included below are
example command-lines for Windows and UNIX systems.

The examples assume that the Java bin directory has been added to your path.

1.1 Windows Command-Line
------------------------

Assuming you have an appropriate JRE/JDK installed and have placed the
Portecle and BouncyCastle Provider JAR files into a directory c:\portecle you can
run Portecle like so:

java -jar c:\portecle\portecle.jar

The portecle-17.jar contains an Icon file for use with Portecle.

1.2 UNIX Command-Line
---------------------

Assuming you have an appropriate JRE/JDK installed and have placed the
Portecle and BouncyCastle Provider JAR files into a directory /portecle you
can run Portecle like so:
