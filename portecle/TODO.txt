TODO for next version (0.2):
- UI + docs for setting the "show splash screen" option
- Improve browserlauncher to work better on recent Linux/Unix.
- Add ChangeLog.txt/NEWS.txt (remember to include experimental stuff).

TODO for website:
- Smaller (in bytes) screenshot for keytool.

TODO for later:
- http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/security/ws03qswp.mspx
- Add "Close keystore" functionality (see also PKCS #11 stuff)
- Fix and clean up or really get rid of "check for update" functionality.
- Icon for "Examine SSL/TLS connection" menu item
- PKCS #11
  - icon for menu item, doc update
  - check "save", "save as" and "change keystore type"
  - logout, login from java.security.AuthProvider (from J2SE 5)
- Change "Copy" and "Copy as XML" in keystore report to "Save as (XML)".
  I have a hunch that clipboards may screw up the encoding which is fatal at
  least with XML...
