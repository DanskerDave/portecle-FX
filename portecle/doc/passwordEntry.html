      Note that <b>PKCS #12</b> Keystore's do not require passwords for their
      Key Pair entries.  This functionallity is therefore not available for
      <b>PKCS #12</b> Keystores.  To set a Keystore Key Pair entry's password:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Right-click on the Key Pair Keystore entry in the
        Keystore Entries table.  Select the <b>Set Password</b> item from
        the resultant pop-up menu.</li>

      <li>The <b>Set Key Pair Entry Password</b> dialog will appear.
        Fill out the dialog's fields with the old password, and new
        password and new password confirmation.  If you have already
        supplied a password for the Key Pair Entry then the old password
        field will have already been filled out for you.  Press the
        <b>OK</b> button to confirm the dialog.</li>
